Titanic Survival Analysis
This project explores the classic Titanic dataset to uncover the key factors that determined passenger survival. The analysis is done using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle / Seaborn titanic.csv

Columns: 15 (after feature engineering)

📌 Objectives

Analyze survival rates based on gender and age.

Determine the impact of passenger class and fare on survival.

Investigate the role of family size.

Assess the correlation between embarkation port and survival.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 3

📈 Key Insights

Gender was the strongest predictor: Females had a ~75% survival rate, compared to under 20% for males.

Wealth provided a clear advantage: First-class passengers had a much higher survival rate (~63%) than third-class passengers (~24%).

Children had a higher chance of survival: The "women and children first" protocol is visible in the data.

Small families were safest: Passengers traveling in groups of 2-4 had better survival odds than those traveling alone or in large families.
